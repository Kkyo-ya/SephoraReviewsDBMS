I told myself I\'d buy this scent once I finished my gummy bear scent. Eventually time came and ordered the vanilla, only to be very disappointed. There\'s barely any vanilla scent, and in fact there is this very pungent, industrial, chemical smell to it! I used about half of the product and then couldn\'t take it anymore. I wonder if it\'s a bad batch or something? Has anyone else had this problem with the vanilla? For anyone thinking of getting the vanilla, be careful because there was something seriously wrong with mine.', 9, 10001, 101, 2),

Although this is not for people with oily or combination skin since it makes your face shiny, I do recommend it for dry skin. I am not sure why someone mentioned it dried their skin because I do find it moisturizing. I wish Dior would make this same primer but for oily skin because I did like its moisturizing effect. I know most people love the shine, but I don\'t like to roam around looking as if I applied cooking oil on my face.', 12, 10002, 102, 3),

I\'m combo skin, with some signs of aging and acne prone. I felt that it did reduce some of my fine lines but was a bit too much moisture to wear during the day. So I opted for nighttime use. Big cons for me were the scent, a very strong floral scent that was almost over powering, and the fact that it is not cruelty free or vegan, as I am trying to shift over to only cruelty free and vegan cosmetics and skincare. A big pro for me was the eco friendly packaging. I thought it was lovely that it could be refilled!', 14, 10002, 102, 4),

I\'m not giving up on this and am working on my skin, hopefully it will work eventually and it\'s just my skin!', 15, 10002, 102, 3),

It gives my skin a little glow which I liked. However, after fifteen minutes, it makes my face so greasy that it looks like I applied oil on my face. I didn\'t notice any change with dark spots. I also tried it before applying my make up. I didn\'t notice any difference from when I apply my makeup without it. I didn\'t notice any difference in my skin except for making my skin extra oily and shiny. In fact, my skin started breaking out so badly. think the packaging is super nice and I really like how it smelled and felt. But I would never use it again. This might work for some people, but did not suit my combination skin.', 16, 10002, 102, 1),

Using this everyday the steering fragrance has died down, to my nose at least. I think it adds a nice brightness to my face, but it\'s not very moisturising. The instructions say you can use it alone after cleansing, but it was not moisturising enough to use on its own for me. I love the pump bottle and that it\'s refillable. A little goes a long way! Even though this product costs more than I would normally spend I would probably purchase this again.', 17, 10002, 102, 3),
	(1018, 'Lovin this!', 'I got this to review through Influenster, and was absolutely thrilled! When I first tried it I was really surprised at how smooth this was on the skin. It blurred a decent amount of imperfections, and was great under my foundation. My makeup didnt slide around my face even though I was cleaning the whole house for 4 hours that day. The only thing that threw me off was the slight perfume scent. It didnt bother me but I did really enjoy it. I also have to mention that 3 days later my town experienced a very large wild fire, and we had to evacuate. While packing to leave, I ended up throwing this into the emergency bags. Once we got to the hotel and I was finally able to wash off all the ash that fell on me. I used the Dior product to help my skin rehydrate, and it really helped me feel human again in more ways than one. It was a small but much needed comfort in a super harsh time of stress. I love this product!', 18, 10002, 102, 4),
	(1019, 'Dior Dream Skin Care and Perfect', 'I have been using this product compliments of @Influenster for review purposes for 2 months now. I\'ve used it as a final step after my skincare routine and before make-up as a primer. I haven\'t changed my skincare routine except adding this. I am pretty tough on luxury products as I feel they have more to prove especially with a $120 price tag. I used other products out of this line I thought were terrible, not worth the money or there was something else comparable in end results at a lower price. Now this product actually wowed me and that takes alot. I noticed my skin to be very luminous, but without any glitter type particles, just a beautiful lit from within glow. My skin has looked amazing since using this, my pores look diminished, it provides a beautiful luminosity with or without makeup, even with a matte foundation. Overall skin appearance has been lovely! The formula is light and silky and sinks into the skin quite quickly with zero tackiness. The packaging is very pretty as well and is refillable so less waste with continued use. Gave 4 Stars because of the price but will continue to repurchase.*Recieved complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes', 19, 10002, 102, 4),
	(1020, 'Really good primer.', 'Its a gorgeous primer. It leaves your skin feeling soft and supple and is a great base for your makeup, everything looks smooth and pretty. As for the anti-aging benefits, I cannot speak directly for those because I didn\'t use this product consistently enough to see any type of the results. When I wear a full face of makeup I tend to give my skin a day off to breath if I can help it. I know that there have been many days that I have worn this on it\'s own, without makeup just to even out my skin a bit and even for that purpose it looks nice. Overall I really enjoyed the product but I do think it\'s a bit pricey for what is essentially just a primer but it is a great one.', 20, 10002, 102, 4),

I liked my HA serum si much and previously used a niacinamine serum that had a low percentage so I thought I\'d try this one and step up my game. But I find this serum doesn\'t love my skin; it stings the tiniest bit, is sudsy when I rub/tap it in, and I find it tends to pill, even if I let it sink in for a while. I\'ve started to mix it in with my moisturizer instead and it\'s helping a little but I still don\'t love this product. I\'m going to use up the rest and move on.', 4, 10003, 103, 2),

	(1028, 'not for sensitive skin', 'I thought this product would help smooth/even out my skin\'s texture but it burned me so badly. I tried the sandwich method of putting it on after a thicker moisturizer but I just think the percentage is simply too high for my sensitive skin. I am used to acids such as hyaluronic and retinol but I\'d never had niacinamide by itself in a product, let alone in a concentration so high.', 27, 10003, 103, 1),
	(1029, 'Excellent serum, especially for the price!', 'I\'m so glad I bought this product. It has definitely helped my dry desert skin.I even stopped my skincare routine for a day to test how my natural skin was, and my face wasn\'t as dry as it usually is w/o skincare.It is a bit sticky when it dries, but if you have horribly dry skin like me it will sink in eventually on its own, or follow up with a moisturizer like I do and the stickiness goes away and your skin will feel hydrated and smooth.', 28, 10004, 103, 5),

I know that if you are in a dry area, the hyaluronic acid will draw moisture from your skin - leaving it drier, so I tried to pair this product with light moisturizers, but it caused me to breakout. It doesn\'t layer well with makeup either. At night, it\'s super drying - it\'s not a comfortable feeling. I\'ll pass. I\'d still recommend it because hyaluronic acid is a great product for (if used properly), but I suggest you do a patch test because this formulation may not work for you', 30, 10004, 103, 1),
	(1032, 'Amazing results', 'I\'ve been using this serum for two months now and it\'s made a huge improvement to my skin. I\'ve tried many, many products, expensive brands Lauder, La Mer, Shiseido, clinique, and more, but nothing had any effect on the deep wrinkles/creases on my forehead, except for this little miracle. Just using this stuff morning & night after washing my face & before applying a light moisturizer for 2 months the forehead creases are now barely visible. It\'s also gotten rid of the fine lines around my eyes and also has gotten rid of my under eye puffiness. I have sensitive skin & many products irritate and/or cause breakouts, but not this stuff. This is a really amazing product and not expensive at all.', 31, 10004, 103, 5),

Topping it off with the oil before it dries completely guards against the tackiness you might otherwise experience, and seals I the moisture.

I have super dry, sensitive skin and being able to control the amount of hyaluronic acid I can use in my routine is really key to keeping it moisturized and balanced. All of The Ordinary products I\'ve tried have been great, but I continue to buy this when I\'m close to running out. This is the last serum I put on before moisturizer. It does feel a little tacky at first, but once you put on moisturizer that goes away.

My initial thoughts are that this product is very easy to use and very sticky when applying products over it. After it has dried down, there is a very obvious plumping of the skin.

My skin is always dewy when I\'ve no product on my face after cleansing. I have no fine lines. Maybe the people that tried it didn\'t put enough product on, or this isn\'t for their skin. Regardless, this is a holy grail and I do not foresee myself ever without this product. I was skeptical at first, too. It was only until I finished my first bottle (sample size) that I really saw the difference in my skin with and without this product.

But this mask was sensitive enough that when applied over my eczema, it didn\'t sting nor cause further irritation. Maybe it was placebo, but I think it helped the eczema on my face go away?

It is heavily scented, but it\'s a lovely smell, exactly like the Body Shop Strawberry Body Butter. It\'s a very interesting whipped texture, so I like to use it by warming it between my hands and applying to the skin. I rub it in for about 30 seconds, wet it and rub a little, then go in with a cleanser to remove it. It takes maybe 50% longer to take all my makeup off than my usual balm, but it gets EVERYTHING. I\'ve only had to go in once with a micellar water for mascara smudges. The packaging is luxe and for the price, definitely would buy again (similar price per oz for the Clinique one, my fav).

It is definitely a balm, which turns into an oil and does not have any grittiness to it. I use this at night as a first step of my double cleanse method and remove it in the shower. I realized that the more water you add to it, the oilier it becomes. It feels like an oil slick on my face, which I don\'t love but don\'t hate. However, I find the oil very difficult to remove with just water and may have been luck taking it off with a washcloth. It leaves a significant film and you MUST use a cleanser afterwards. I will say in the directions, it suggests to use their Blueberry Bounce Cleanser (which apparently is good at also removing makeup) but I can\'t use this right now because I am pregnant. So I used the Mad Hippie Cream Cleanser and it did remove the access oil. The good thing is because it is so emollient, it removes all traces of makeup, including my mascara (not waterproof).

I don\'t use cleansing balms to remove my eye makeup because I prefer micellar water for that but I do use three sunscreens and this did the job of removing everything. I always follow up my oil cleansers with a gentle gel or cream cleanser to remove all traces of oil. This double cleanse has changed my skins life!

It does not lather much at all. No complaints but not sure if I want to switch from my current Farmacy cleanser. Watermelon glow toner has a bit of a sticky feel. Maybe I\'m old school but I\'ve also never used a toner that you don\'t swipe over the face with a pad. Dabbing it onto my skin feels time consuming as well as waiting for it to dry. I do not feel like my pores look any smaller. Strawberry Serum is also sticky. When combined with the Watermelon Glow Dew Drops (like the package recommended) I had significant piling. Applying makeup on top looked terrible and I ended up washing my face and starting over. I find the dew drops on their own make me look more shiny than dewy. I am enjoying the Plum Plump cream. I feel like it might be a little too light for the winter. I\'ve been using it in the morning and using a heavier moisturizer at night. Overall I am happy with some of the products.

Personally, I was unimpressed and will not buy it again. I used this in conjunction with their skincare line. However, given my misfortune with this product I can say that it does do a good job at leaving the skin feeling clean and not tight. There is almost no scent as it is very light.

I felt cleansed and didn\'t feel dried out at all...Then, dry spots started forming on my neck, just under my jaw. I stupidly continued using this for about another day before catching on that this was probably the reason I was turning into a reptile.Now I have completely stopped using this but I have HORRIBLE patches of dry, dandruffy skin ALL OVER my face--anywhere it came in contact with. INCLUDING MY EYELIDS, which I barely touched.After using for one week, and now stopping for one week, I am still constantly flaking all over the place but at least none of the patches are growing anymore.
